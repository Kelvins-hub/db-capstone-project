/*SQL SCHEDULED EVENTS
The purpose of Scheduled Events in SQL (especially in MySQL)is to automate tasks 
that would otherwise require manual executionor external scripts (like cron jobs). 
They allow your database to run SQL statements at scheduled times or intervals â€” kind
 of like built-in alarms that do work for you.*/
 
 #THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF SCHEDULE EVENTS
 #1. ONE TIME EVENTS
 #2. REOCCURING EVENTS

/*an example of a MySQL scheduled event that inserts total sales at the close of business
into a simple report table. This is a one-off event, meaning it runs only
 once at a specific time */

/*ðŸ”§ What This Command Does
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON; turns the scheduler on at the server level.

It allows scheduled EVENTS to start running at their defined times.*/
